# Clean-and-contaminatd-region-segmentation-in-the-WCE-images-using-GBC-model
Segmentation of clear and contaminated regions in capsule endoscopy images using LAB color space. K-means clustering (K=20) was applied to the 3-D color histograms, followed by fitting Gaussian models to clean/contaminated pixels. Pixels are classified by maximum probability from the two distributions
